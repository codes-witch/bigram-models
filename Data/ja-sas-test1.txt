You are a good woman , he warmly replied .
She saw their sashes untied , their hair pulled about their ears , their work-bags searched , and their knives and scissors stolen away , and felt no doubt of its being a reciprocal enjoyment .
And with this pleasing anticipation , she sat down to reconsider the past , recall the words and endeavour to comprehend all the feelings of Edward ; and , of course , to reflect on her own with discontent .
The contents of her last note to him were these :  --        What am I to imagine , Willoughby , by your behaviour last      night ? 
I should always be happy , replied Elinor , to show any mark of my esteem and friendship for Mr. Ferrars ; but do you not perceive that my interest on such an occasion would be perfectly unnecessary ? 
He , her father , a well-meaning , but not a quick-sighted man , could really , I believe , give no information ; for he had been generally confined to the house , while the girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they chose ; and he tried to convince me , as thoroughly as he was convinced himself , of his daughter's being entirely unconcerned in the business .
But now I can carry her a most satisfactory account of both .
Surprised and alarmed they proceeded directly into the room she had just quitted , where they found only Willoughby , who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his back towards them .
I say awakened , because time and London , business and dissipation , had in some measure quieted it , and I had been growing a fine hardened villain , fancying myself indifferent to her , and choosing to fancy that she too must have become indifferent to me ; talking to myself of our past attachment as a mere idle , trifling business , shrugging up my shoulders in proof of its being so , and silencing every reproach , overcoming every scruple , by secretly saying now and then , I shall be heartily glad to hear she is well married .
Her mother , sisters , Fanny , all had been conscious of his regard for her at Norland ; it was not an illusion of her own vanity .
Delaford is a nice place , I can tell you ; exactly what I call a nice old fashioned place , full of comforts and conveniences ; quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered with the best fruit-trees in the country ; and such a mulberry tree in one corner !
This violent oppression of spirits continued the whole evening .
But one must not expect every thing ; though I suppose it would be no difficult matter to widen them .
When that was once done , however , it was time for the raptures of Edward to cease ; for Marianne's joy hurried her into the drawing-room immediately .
In a firm , though cautious tone , Elinor thus began .
Rather say your mother's imprudence , my child , said Mrs. Dashwood ;  she  must be answerable .
No ,  that  he is not .
After an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat , or in other words , in every variety of inquiry concerning all their acquaintance on Mrs. Jennings's side , and in laughter without cause on Mrs. Palmer's , it was proposed by the latter that they should all accompany her to some shops where she had business that morning , to which Mrs. Jennings and Elinor readily consented , as having likewise some purchases to make themselves ; and Marianne , though declining it at first was induced to go likewise .
Mrs. Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor --   Get it all out of her , my dear .
Yes ; once , while she was staying in this house , I happened to drop in for ten minutes ; and I saw quite enough of her .
You have no ambition , I well know .
Certainly , said Elinor ; and assisted by her liberality , I hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances .
And yet this woman -- who knows what her art may have been ?  -- how long it may have been premeditated , and how deeply contrived by her ! -- Who is she ?  -- Who can she be ?  -- Whom did I ever hear him talk of as young and attractive among his female acquaintance ?  -- Oh ! no one , no one :  -- he talked to me only of myself .
Well may you wonder , Marianne , replied her brother , at the obstinacy which could resist such arguments as these .
Really , said Elinor , I know so little of these kind of forms , that I can hardly even conjecture as to the time , or the preparation necessary ; but I suppose two or three months will complete his ordination .
She could consult with her brother , could receive her sister-in-law on her arrival , and treat her with proper attention ; and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion , and encourage her to similar forbearance .
Your sister , I hope , cannot be offended , said he , by the resemblance I have fancied between her and my poor disgraced relation .
I never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before , I assure you , said Elinor .
Her husband , but with great humility , did not see the force of her objection .
They had too much sense to be desirable companions to the former ; and by the latter they were considered with a jealous eye , as intruding on  their  ground , and sharing the kindness which they wanted to monopolize .
After some time spent in saying little or doing less , Lady Middleton sat down to Cassino , and as Marianne was not in spirits for moving about , she and Elinor luckily succeeding to chairs , placed themselves at no great distance from the table .
Good gracious ! -- In a moment I shall see the person that all my happiness depends on -- that is to be my mother !
An opportunity was soon to be given to the Dashwoods of debating on the rest of the children , as Sir John would not leave the house without securing their promise of dining at the park the next day .
I can guess what his business is , however , said Mrs. Jennings exultingly .
Mrs. Ferrars too -- in short it has been a scene of such complicated distress -- but I will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us quite overcome .
But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy , and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy .
She wondered that Lucy's spirits could be so very much elevated by the civility of Mrs. Ferrars ; -- that her interest and her vanity should so very much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid her because she was  not Elinor  appear a compliment to herself -- or to allow her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her , because her real situation was unknown .
These apprehensions , perhaps , were not founded entirely on reason , and certainly not at all on truth .
But there are other points to be considered besides his inclination .
Nor do I think it a part of Marianne's , said Elinor ; I should hardly call her a lively girl -- she is very earnest , very eager in all she does -- sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation -- but she is not often really merry .
Then you would have told me , that it might or might not have happened .
The struggle was great , but it ended too soon .
Dullness is as much produced within doors as without , by rain .
The time may come when Harry will regret that so large a sum was parted with .
Her sleep , though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it , lasted a considerable time ; and anxious to observe the result of it herself , she resolved to sit with her during the whole of it .
As for regret , said Marianne , I have done with that , as far as  he  is concerned .
Elinor began to find this impertinence too much for her temper ; but she was saved the trouble of checking it , by Lucy's sharp reprimand , which now , as on many occasions , though it did not give much sweetness to the manners of one sister , was of advantage in governing those of the other .
But have you not received my notes ? cried Marianne in the wildest anxiety .
Do not , my dearest Elinor , let your kindness defend what I know your judgment must censure .
If their praise is censure , your censure may be praise , for they are not more undiscerning , than you are prejudiced and unjust .
What can bring her here so often ? said Marianne , on her leaving them .
Sir John was a sportsman , Lady Middleton a mother .
Like him !
Why should you think so ! replied he , with a sigh .
But the whole of their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable !
His medicines had failed ; the fever was unabated ; and Marianne only more quiet -- not more herself -- remained in a heavy stupor .
The whole was tied up for the benefit of this child , who , in occasional visits with his father and mother at Norland , had so far gained on the affections of his uncle , by such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three years old ; an imperfect articulation , an earnest desire of having his own way , many cunning tricks , and a great deal of noise , as to outweigh all the value of all the attention which , for years , he had received from his niece and her daughters .
And you will never see me otherwise .
From the moment of learning that Lucy was married to another , that Edward was free , to the moment of his justifying the hopes which had so instantly followed , she was every thing by turns but tranquil .
To quit the neighbourhood of Norland was no longer an evil ; it was an object of desire ; it was a blessing , in comparison of the misery of continuing her daughter-in-law's guest ; and to remove for ever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit or visit it while such a woman was its mistress .
Altogether , they will have five hundred a-year amongst them , and what on earth can four women want for more than that ? 
But it is not in my power to delay my journey for one day !
As Mrs. Jennings could talk on no other subject , Elinor soon saw the necessity of preparing Marianne for its discussion .
She would not be frightened from paying him those attentions which , as a friend and almost a relation , were his due , by the observant eyes of Lucy , though she soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her .
I confess , replied Elinor , that while I am at Barton Park , I never think of tame and quiet children with any abhorrence .
Ah !
It is not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them .
Mrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of her guest , that she pressed them very earnestly to return with her again from Cleveland .
Mrs. Dashwood , whose terror as they drew near the house had produced almost the conviction of Marianne's being no more , had no voice to inquire after her , no voice even for Elinor ; but  she  , waiting neither for salutation nor inquiry , instantly gave the joyful relief ; and her mother , catching it with all her usual warmth , was in a moment as much overcome by her happiness , as she had been before by her fears .
Her eagerness to be gone from Norland was preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction of her daughter-in-law in the prospect of her removal ; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure .
He was giving orders for a toothpick-case for himself , and till its size , shape , and ornaments were determined , all of which , after examining and debating for a quarter of an hour over every toothpick-case in the shop , were finally arranged by his own inventive fancy , he had no leisure to bestow any other attention on the two ladies , than what was comprised in three or four very broad stares ; a kind of notice which served to imprint on Elinor the remembrance of a person and face , of strong , natural , sterling insignificance , though adorned in the first style of fashion .
Marianne would have thought herself very inexcusable had she been able to sleep at all the first night after parting from Willoughby .
They were three days on their journey , and Marianne's behaviour as they travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and companionableness to Mrs. Jennings might be expected to be .
Edward's marriage with Lucy was as firmly determined on , and the time of its taking place remained as absolutely uncertain , as she had concluded it would be ; -- every thing depended , exactly after her expectation , on his getting that preferment , of which , at present , there seemed not the smallest chance .
Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing ; but her husband civilly hoped that she would not be settled far from Norland .
She had wandered away to a subject on which Elinor had nothing to say , and therefore soon judged it expedient to find her way back again to the first .
And I must say , I think she was used very hardly ; for your sister scolded like any fury , and soon drove her into a fainting fit .
In the present case it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his father or mother , and in what particular he resembled either , for of course every body differed , and every body was astonished at the opinion of the others .
I knew him to be a very good sort of man , and I thought well of his daughter -- better than she deserved , for , with a most obstinate and ill-judged secrecy , she would tell nothing , would give no clue , though she certainly knew all .
But here , Elinor could neither wonder nor blame ; and when she saw , as she assisted Marianne from the carriage , that she had been crying , she saw only an emotion too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity , and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise .
I thought it my duty , said he , independent of my feelings , to give her the option of continuing the engagement or not , when I was renounced by my mother , and stood to all appearance without a friend in the world to assist me .
The youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him to every thing but her beauty and good nature ; but the four succeeding years -- years , which if rationally spent , give such improvement to the understanding , must have opened his eyes to her defects of education , while the same period of time , spent on her side in inferior society and more frivolous pursuits , had perhaps robbed her of that simplicity which might once have given an interesting character to her beauty .
Yes , for I am unable to keep my engagement with you .
Mr. Palmer made her no answer , and did not even raise his eyes from the newspaper .
Whatever they may have been , however , she may now , and hereafter doubtless  will  , turn with gratitude towards her own condition , when she compares it with that of my poor Eliza , when she considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl , and pictures her to herself , with an affection for him so strong , still as strong as her own , and with a mind tormented by self-reproach , which must attend her through life .
But that won't do nowadays ; nothing in the way of pleasure can ever be given up by the young men of this age .
The time was now drawing on , when Colonel Brandon might be expected back .
These words , which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal of his love for her sister , affected her very much .
And what a charming little family they have !
In defence of your  protÈgÈ  you can even be saucy .
To enquire after Marianne was at first his excuse ; but the encouragement of his reception , to which every day gave greater kindness , made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceased to be possible , by Marianne's perfect recovery .
He was under my uncle's care , you know , a considerable while .
But now , after such dishonorable usage , who can tell what were his designs on her .
Had you seen his look , his manner , had you heard his voice at that moment !
Anne and me are to go the latter end of January to some relations who have been wanting us to visit them these several years !
It would be impossible , I know , replied Elinor , to convince you that a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty-five anything near enough to love , to make him a desirable companion to her .
She merely observed that he was perfectly good humoured and friendly .
Willoughby ! cried Sir John ; what , is  he  in the country ? 
My dear madam , said Lady Middleton , recollect what you are saying .
Some lavender drops , however , which she was at length persuaded to take , were of use ; and from that time till Mrs. Jennings returned , she continued on the bed quiet and motionless .
