Though his eyes had been long opened , even before his acquaintance with Elinor began , to her ignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions , they had been equally imputed , by him , to her want of education ; and till her last letter reached him , he had always believed her to be a well-disposed , good-hearted girl , and thoroughly attached to himself .
Marianne was to have the best place by the fire , was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house , and to be amused by the relation of all the news of the day .
They were scarcely ever without some friends staying with them in the house , and they kept more company of every kind than any other family in the neighbourhood .
But so little were they , anymore than the others , inclined to oblige her , that if Sir John dined from home , she might spend a whole day without hearing any other raillery on the subject , than what she was kind enough to bestow on herself .
Barton Park was about half a mile from the cottage .
One moment she feared that no serious design had ever been formed on his side ; and the next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him and her sister .
Fortunately for her , they had now reached the cottage , and the conversation could be continued no farther .
Sir John and Lady Middleton wished it very much .
She was silent .
I have no notion of men's going on in this way ; and if ever I meet him again , I will give him such a dressing as he has not had this many a day .
She feared that under this persuasion she had been unjust , inattentive , nay , almost unkind , to her Elinor ; that Marianne's affliction , because more acknowledged , more immediately before her , had too much engrossed her tenderness , and led her away to forget that in Elinor she might have a daughter suffering almost as much , certainly with less self-provocation , and greater fortitude .
It was then about twelve o'clock , and she returned to her sister's apartment to wait for the arrival of the apothecary , and to watch by her the rest of the night .
That was just like Lucy .
And then to turn the discourse , she began admiring the house and the furniture .
Oh , Willoughby , Willoughby , could this be yours !
Marianne had at first the advantage , but a false step brought her suddenly to the ground ; and Margaret , unable to stop herself to assist her , was involuntarily hurried along , and reached the bottom in safety .
She turned towards Lucy in silent amazement , unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration ; and though her complexion varied , she stood firm in incredulity , and felt in no danger of an hysterical fit , or a swoon .
Elinor's thanks followed this speech with grateful earnestness ; attended too with the assurance of her expecting material advantage to Marianne , from the communication of what had passed .
To me it would seem only a commercial exchange , in which each wished to be benefited at the expense of the other .
The selfish sagacity of the latter , which had at first drawn Robert into the scrape , was the principal instrument of his deliverance from it ; for her respectful humility , assiduous attentions , and endless flatteries , as soon as the smallest opening was given for their exercise , reconciled Mrs. Ferrars to his choice , and re-established him completely in her favour .
I speak from experience .
Are the Middletons pleasant people ? 
When I got to Mr. Palmer's , I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child .
A very little trouble on your side secures him .
And , in short , what do you think of my wife's style of letter-writing ?  -- delicate -- tender -- truly feminine -- was it not ? 
The preferment , which only two days before she had considered as hopeless for Edward , was already provided to enable him to marry ; -- and  she  , of all people in the world , was fixed on to bestow it ! -- Her emotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had attributed to a very different cause ; -- but whatever minor feelings less pure , less pleasing , might have a share in that emotion , her esteem for the general benevolence , and her gratitude for the particular friendship , which together prompted Colonel Brandon to this act , were strongly felt , and warmly expressed .
He had left the girl whose youth and innocence he had seduced , in a situation of the utmost distress , with no creditable home , no help , no friends , ignorant of his address !
And your mother has brought on herself a most appropriate punishment .
Marianne lifted up her eyes in astonishment , and Elinor conjectured that she might as well have held her tongue .
How came they acquainted ? 
That is an expression , Sir John , said Marianne , warmly , which I particularly dislike .
But some of those little attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix him , in spite of himself .
The Miss Dashwoods were young , pretty , and unaffected .
Elinor honoured her for a plan which originated so nobly as this ; though smiling to see the same eager fancy which had been leading her to the extreme of languid indolence and selfish repining , now at work in introducing excess into a scheme of such rational employment and virtuous self-control .
Willoughby opened the piano-forte , and asked Marianne to sit down to it ; and thus amidst the various endeavours of different people to quit the topic , it fell to the ground .
I am , said he .
Elinor , said John , your reasoning is very good , but it is founded on ignorance of human nature .
My dear Madam , I always say to her , you must make yourself easy .
Everybody has a way of their own .
Lucy was all exultation on being so honorably distinguished ; and Miss Steele wanted only to be teased about Dr. Davies to be perfectly happy .
You are very obliging .
It was enough for her that he appeared to be amiable , that he loved her daughter , and that Elinor returned the partiality .
Miss Steele was the least discomposed of the three , by their presence ; and it was in their power to reconcile her to it entirely .
I suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister , Miss Dashwood , when they come to town , said Lucy , returning , after a cessation of hostile hints , to the charge .
Marianne's was finished in a very few minutes ; in length it could be no more than a note ; it was then folded up , sealed , and directed with eager rapidity .
And now to be sure you will be in no  hurry  to be gone .
But you look grave , Marianne ; do you disapprove your sister's choice ? 
My cousins have been so plaguing me !
And I assure you I never was better pleased in my life , and I wish you joy of it with all my heart .
A more reasonable cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the indulgence of his affection .
I have not time to speak to Mrs. Jennings about it myself , but pray tell her I am quite happy to hear she is not in anger against us , and Lady Middleton the same ; and if anything should happen to take you and your sister away , and Mrs. Jennings should want company , I am sure we should be very glad to come and stay with her for as long a time as she likes .
The consequence of this , upon a mind so young , so lively , so inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon's , was but too natural .
Their intended excursion to Whitwell turned out very different from what Elinor had expected .
He likes you .
Elinor , who knew that such grief , shocking as it was to witness it , must have its course , watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat spent itself , and then turning eagerly to Willoughby's letter , read as follows :  --   Bond Street , January .
He left her house yesterday , but where he is gone , or whether he is still in town , I do not know ; for  we  of course can make no inquiry .
Oh !
It must be so .
This event , while it raised the spirits of Elinor , restored to those of her sister all , and more than all , their former agitation .
A few months ago it would have hurt her exceedingly ; but it was not in Mrs. Ferrars' power to distress her by it now ; and the difference of her manners to the Miss Steeles , a difference which seemed purposely made to humble her more , only amused her .
I was exceedingly pleased to hear that Mrs. Ferrars considered it in that light ; a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all .
I declare I quite doat upon them already , and indeed I am always distractedly fond of children .
Much as she had suffered from her first conversation with Lucy on the subject , she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it ; and this for more reasons than one .
Your father thought only of  them  And I must say this :  that you owe no particular gratitude to him , nor attention to his wishes ; for we very well know that if he could , he would have left almost everything in the world to  them .
Have you , she continued , after a short silence , ever seen Mr. Willoughby since you left him at Barton ? 
I care not who knows that I am wretched .
She played over every favourite song that she had been used to play to Willoughby , every air in which their voices had been oftenest joined , and sat at the instrument gazing on every line of music that he had written out for her , till her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness could be gained ; and this nourishment of grief was every day applied .
Should not you , Mr. Palmer ? 
The event has proved , that I was a cunning fool , providing with great circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself contemptible and wretched for ever .
Edward , she believed , was still in town , and fortunately she had heard his address from Miss Steele .
Yes ; and he was up again at eight to ride to covert .
What had really passed between them was to this effect .
Yes , he replied , with some embarrassment , almost ever since ; I have been once or twice at Delaford for a few days , but it has never been in my power to return to Barton .
He looked at them slightly , without seeming to know who they were , and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from the other side of the room .
It is of importance that no time should be lost with him , for he will of course have much to do relative to his ordination .
Are those who have been disappointed in their first choice , whether from the inconstancy of its object , or the perverseness of circumstances , to be equally indifferent during the rest of their lives ? 
If the violence of her passions , the weakness of her understanding -- I do not mean , however , to defend myself .
Marianne would not let her proceed ; -- and Elinor , satisfied that each felt their own error , wished to avoid any survey of the past that might weaken her sister's spirits ; she , therefore , pursuing the first subject , immediately continued --   One observation may , I think , be fairly drawn from the whole of the story -- that all Willoughby's difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue , in his behaviour to Eliza Williams .
Not a stone must be added to its walls , not an inch to its size , if my feelings are regarded .
Oh , what would  he  say to that !
She was remarkably quick in the discovery of attachments , and had enjoyed the advantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady by insinuations of her power over such a young man ; and this kind of discernment enabled her soon after her arrival at Barton decisively to pronounce that Colonel Brandon was very much in love with Marianne Dashwood .
After staying with them half an hour , he asked Elinor to walk with him to Conduit Street , and introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton .
I am sure your mother can spare you very well , and I  do  beg you will favour me with your company , for I've quite set my heart upon it .
Willoughby filled every page .
I do not understand you , replied he , colouring .
They were all thoughtless or indolent .
By their uncertain light she thought she could discern it to be drawn by four horses ; and this , while it told the excess of her poor mother's alarm , gave some explanation to such unexpected rapidity .
The reason alleged was their determined resolution of not leaving their mother at that time of the year .
She could not be deceived in that .
No positive engagement indeed ! after taking her all over Allenham House , and fixing on the very rooms they were to live in hereafter !
Dear , dear Norland , said Elinor , probably looks much as it always does at this time of the year -- the woods and walks thickly covered with dead leaves .
At last he turned round again , and regarded them both ; she started up , and pronouncing his name in a tone of affection , held out her hand to him .
But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and Marianne will make amends for the regard of Lady Middleton and her mother .
This living of Colonel Brandon's -- can it be true ?  -- has he really given it to Edward ?  -- I heard it yesterday by chance , and was coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it .
That sentence is very prettily turned .
But she soon saw how likely it was that Lucy , in her self-provident care , in her haste to secure him , should overlook every thing but the risk of delay .
Law , my dear !
To have resisted such attractions , to have withstood such tenderness !
This lady was one of my nearest relations , an orphan from her infancy , and under the guardianship of my father .
If he would only have done as well by himself , said John Dashwood , as all his friends were disposed to do by him , he might now have been in his proper situation , and would have wanted for nothing .
